# Domain

The `domain` directory contains all the core business logic of the application. It is isolated from external influences such as user interfaces or data persistence. This encapsulation ensures that the business rules and policies are expressed cleanly and can be easily tested and maintained. The domain layer acts as the application's foundation, where the essential operations and business model definitions reside.
