# Input Ports

The `domain/ports/in` directory contains interfaces for primary (or driving) ports through which the application receives inputs or commands. These are used by external actors (e.g., users through a web interface) to perform operations on the application. Primary ports typically will be implemented by the application's controllers or other inbound adaptors.
