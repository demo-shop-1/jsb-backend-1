# Application

The  `application/` directory serves as a collection point for service adapters, which are responsible for connecting the application's core logic to external systems. These adapters implement the interfaces defined by the domain services, translating between the domain models and the external systems. This approach ensures that the core application remains decoupled from external dependencies, promoting flexibility, ease of testing, and scalability.
