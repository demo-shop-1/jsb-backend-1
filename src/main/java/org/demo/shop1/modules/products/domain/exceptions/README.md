# Exceptions

The `domain/exceptions` directory is a crucial component of the domain layer in applications structured using Hexagonal or similar layered architectures. This package specifically houses all the custom exceptions that are directly related to the application's domain logic. Custom exceptions encapsulate specific error conditions that can occur due to domain rules being violated or other issues that are specific to the domain logic of the application.
