# Adapter Entities

This directory contains the Entity classes used in the persistence layer of the Hexagonal Architecture for the hexagonal Spring Boot application. The entities in this directory are specifically tailored for use with MongoDB to facilitate interactions with the database. They are distinct from the domain models located in the `domain/models` directory, which are designed to be purely business-centric and free from any infrastructure-related annotations or dependencies.
